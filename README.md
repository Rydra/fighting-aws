# Fighting-aws

An incredible fighting game over the huge battlefield of Amazon! Help our hero survive the endless stream of monsters!

# How to make it work

Install the dependencies with the following command:

`pipenv install`

You should be all set and ready to play!

# The hero

The hero is the one that awaits monsters. Open a console and execute the following command:

`pipenv run python hero.py`

This will put the hero in position, waiting for the monsters to arrive. You can open as many heroes as you can,
they will join the fight and appreciate reinforcements! If a hero dies (HP = 0) that worker will quit.

You can damage or heal the heroes by executing the following respectively:

```
pipenv run python monster.py
pipenv run python healer.py
```
